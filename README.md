Google Drive Like Photo Storage Using Blockchain.


Description:
This project we've established a decentralized Google Drive-like system using React JS for the front end and Solidity for the back end. 
Leveraging the power of IPFS through Pinata, we ensure secure and tamper-proof photo storage with unique hash generation.
Smart contracts govern access control, guaranteeing privacy and user control. 
The backend is reinforced by Hardhat, ensuring efficient interactions with Ethereum, while MetaMask integration enhances user authentication.
This helps in reshaping photo management, making it secure, transparent, and user-centric.
